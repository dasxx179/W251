Part 1:
1. In the time allowed, how many images did you annotate?
I annotated 51 images.
2. Home many instances of the Millennium Falcon did you annotate? How many TIE Fighters?
I annoted 45 images of Millennium Falcon and 37 images of TIE Fighters.
3. Based on this experience, how would you handle the annotation of large image data set?
I would automate what I currently am doing for a larger set with some sort of unsupervised learning method.
4. Think about image augmentation? How would augmentations such as flip, rotation, scale, cropping, and translation effect the annotations?
It would diversify the image set and provide much more information.
Part 2:
Describe the following augmentations in your own words
1. Flip
Mirrors the image around its axis running through the center
2. Rotation
Turns the image around a point
3. Scale
Make smaller or bigger
4. Crop
Cut out pieces of image
5. Translation
Move the image horizontally or vertically
6. Noise
Random variation that may impede information about the image
Part 3:
1. Image annotations require the coordinates of the objects and their classes; in your option, what is needed for an audio annotation?
Decibel information and frequency information
Time of transmission (time of initial tranmission and final transmission)
Medium sound is going through
